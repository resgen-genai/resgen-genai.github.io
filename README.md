## Audio Samples
### Uncurated Samples from ResGen (625M) Models

This section provides examples of uncurated audio samples generated by the ResGen (625M) models. The samples demonstrate the model's performance in two tasks:

1. **Samples of Continuation Task**:  
   - **Generated Sample Details**: The first 3 seconds are ground truth speech, and the subsequent portion is generated by the model.

2. **Samples of Cross-Sentence Task**:  
   - **Generated Sample Details**: The *italicized* portion of the text is used as the prompt for the model, and the remaining portion of the audio is generated.
